## Description

App that takes user input from CLI and creates an HTML document displaying information about the team members. Can be used for any given project.

In this project, I learned a bit more about test-driven development and got to experience a bit more about what it means to write code to pass tests. In the end, I decided not to use any of the code that I wrote to pass these tests, but it was an informative experience nonetheless.

I've included my first draft of code for the sake of hitting all the requirements of this assignment and commented out the code. The code that is active is what I came up with after much refactoring. The final draft of my code does not use any of the extended classes and only requires the Employee class file to reduce repitition.

The two most challenging portions of this assignement were figuring out how to render an HTML file as well as refactoring to avoid using three different functions for three different classes.
